# Data Model: Deploy Paperclip to GCP in Public Authentication Mode

**Date**: 2026-04-09
**Last updated**: 2026-04-10
**Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)
**Plan**: [plan.md](./plan.md)

This document models two layers:

1. **Deployed-resource model** — the GCP resources Terraform manages
   inside the dedicated `paperclip-492823` project.
2. **Application entities** — the entities the spec defines (board
   operator, invitation, agent, etc.) and how the deployment hosts them.
   These are owned by Paperclip's own database; the deployment provides
   the substrate.

---

## Layer 1 — Resources in the dedicated `paperclip-492823` project

Single environment. Single dedicated project. No co-tenant workloads.
**The only resource Paperclip explicitly avoids is the project's
default Compute service account** (`280667224791-compute@developer.gserviceaccount.com`),
which exists in every GCP project with broad legacy privileges and
should never be attached to a Paperclip workload — Paperclip uses its
own narrowly-scoped `paperclip-runtime-sa` instead.

### Paperclip resources (managed by Terraform in `infra/`)

Single environment. Resources are prefixed `paperclip-` or
`paperclipai-` (good practice for IAM hygiene and quick filtering,
not required for collision avoidance now that the project is
dedicated). All resources carry the label `service=paperclip` for
cost attribution.

### Resource lifecycle and state transitions

| Resource | Created when | Modified when | Destroyed when |
|---|---|---|---|
| Enabled APIs | First `terraform apply` | Almost never | If Paperclip is decommissioned (and the API isn't used by other workloads) |
| paperclip-vpc + subnet + connector | First `terraform apply` | Almost never | Paperclip teardown |
| paperclip-pg Cloud SQL instance | First `terraform apply` | Tier/HA changes (in-place), version bumps (planned outage) | Never automatically (`prevent_destroy=true`) |
| paperclip-492823-uploads GCS bucket | First `terraform apply` | Lifecycle/versioning changes (safe) | Never automatically (`prevent_destroy=true`) |
| paperclip-* Secret Manager entries | Bootstrap scripts (`bootstrap-master-key.sh`, `bootstrap-gcs-hmac.sh`), then Terraform | New versions added on rotation | Old versions disabled, never deleted |
| paperclip Cloud Run Service | First `terraform apply` | Every deploy (new revision) | Never automatically |
| Cloud Run revisions | Every deploy | Immutable | Cloud Run retains the most recent N revisions; older ones GC'd by Cloud Run |
| paperclipai-doctor Cloud Run Job | First `terraform apply` | Image bumps follow service | Never automatically |
| paperclip Cloud DNS zone + records | First `terraform apply` | Hostname changes | Hostname changes |
| Cloud Run domain mapping | First `terraform apply` | Hostname changes | Hostname changes |
| paperclip Artifact Registry repo | First `terraform apply` | Almost never | Paperclip teardown |
| paperclip-github WIF pool | First `terraform apply` | New providers added | Paperclip teardown |
| Alerting policies | First `terraform apply` | Threshold tuning | Paperclip teardown |
| paperclip-492823-tf-state GCS bucket | One-time, before first apply (manual) | Never | Paperclip teardown (last) |

### Validation rules (enforced by Terraform / module variables / CI)

- `paperclip_image_digest` MUST match `^sha256:[a-f0-9]{64}$`. Tag-only
  references are rejected at plan time.
- `cloud_run_min_instances` MUST be ≥ 2 (single-env, no cold starts allowed).
- `cloud_sql_availability_type` MUST equal `REGIONAL` (single-env is
  treated as production; HA is non-negotiable).
- `gcs_uniform_bucket_level_access` MUST be `true`. Variable has no
  override.
- `gcs_public_access_prevention` MUST be `enforced`. Variable has no
  override.
- `cloud_run_service_account` MUST NOT be the project's default Compute
  service account (`280667224791-compute@…`). Variable rejects it.
- `paperclip_deployment_mode` MUST equal `public`. The compute module
  hardcodes this; it cannot be set to `local_trusted` or `private` from
  tfvars.
- **Every Paperclip-managed resource MUST carry the `service=paperclip`
  label.** Enforced by a checkov / tflint rule in CI; PRs that introduce
  unlabeled resources fail PR checks.
- **Every Paperclip-managed resource MUST have a name prefixed
  `paperclip-` or `paperclipai-`** (or `greeteat-paperclip-` for the
  GCS bucket where the org prefix is helpful for global uniqueness).
  Enforced by a CI rule.
- `cloud_run_service_account` MUST NOT have any role outside the
  five listed in the Compute section above. Enforced by an integration
  check that compares the actual IAM bindings against the allowlist.

## Layer 2 — Application entities (owned by Paperclip)

These are the spec's Key Entities, hosted inside Paperclip's own database
on Cloud SQL `paperclip-pg`. The deployment provides the database
substrate; the schema itself is managed by Paperclip's Drizzle migrations.

### Board Operator

| Attribute | Notes |
|---|---|
| Identity | Better Auth user record (UUID, identifier, hashed credential) |
| Session | Database-backed Better Auth session row, cookie-bound |
| Permissions | Scoped to one or more companies via membership rows |
| Created via | Invitation claim (no other path) |
| Revoked via | Operator-callable endpoint that deletes sessions and disables the user record; takes effect on the next request |

### Invitation

| Attribute | Notes |
|---|---|
| Token | Opaque, single-use, ~10 minute TTL |
| Issuer | Foreign key to Board Operator |
| Target | Identifier (email or arbitrary string), purely informational |
| Status | `pending` / `claimed` / `expired` / `revoked` |
| Claim URL | `https://<deployment-domain>/api/invites/<token>` (returned to inviter, auto-copied to clipboard) |
| Delivery | Out-of-band by the inviter — the deployment ships no email |

State transitions:

```text
[create] → pending
pending  → claimed   (POST/PUT /api/invites/:token/claim)
pending  → expired   (TTL elapsed)
pending  → revoked   (operator action)
claimed  → (terminal)
expired  → (terminal)
revoked  → (terminal)
```

### Agent

| Attribute | Notes |
|---|---|
| Identity | Paperclip agent record, scoped to a Company |
| Credentials | Short-lived JWT (heartbeat-delivered) OR long-lived API key (per-agent, hashed at rest) |
| Authorization | Company-scoped — cannot access another company's resources |
| Revoked via | Operator action; effective within seconds against the live deployment |
| LLM backend | Vertex AI Claude Sonnet 4.6, via Claude Code spawned by `claude_local` adapter, authenticated via `paperclip-runtime-sa` |

### Company

| Attribute | Notes |
|---|---|
| Identity | Paperclip company record |
| Members | Set of Board Operators via membership rows |
| Resources | Owns Agents, Goals, Tasks, Budgets |
| Authorization boundary | Cross-company access is denied at the application layer (FR-008) |

### Authentication Event

| Attribute | Notes |
|---|---|
| Type | sign-up / sign-in / sign-in-failure / lockout / invitation-issued / session-revoked |
| Actor | Board Operator or anonymous |
| Timestamp | UTC, monotonic |
| Source | IP, user agent (where applicable) |
| Outcome | success / failure / blocked |
| Correlation ID | Joins this event to subsequent agent activity |
| **Storage** | Paperclip emits a structured log line tagged `service=paperclip event=auth`; the deployment's Log Router routes it to the `paperclip-audit-logs` log bucket with 90-day retention (FR-020) |

### Agent Run

| Attribute | Notes |
|---|---|
| Identity | Paperclip run record |
| Initiated by | A heartbeat or event |
| Correlation ID | Joins to authentication events and to tool-invocation log lines |
| **Storage** | `paperclip-pg` for state; Cloud Logging for activity stream |

---

## Cross-layer relationships

| Application entity | Hosted on / depends on |
|---|---|
| Board Operator, Invitation, Agent, Company, Agent Run | `paperclip-pg` Cloud SQL Postgres, Drizzle-managed schema |
| Authentication Event | Cloud Logging → routed to `paperclip-audit-logs` log bucket |
| Uploaded files (attachments) | `paperclip-492823-uploads` GCS bucket via S3 interop API |
| Master encryption key | `paperclip-master-key` Secret Manager → injected into Cloud Run service env |
| LLM provider (Anthropic Claude) | **Vertex AI Model Garden** in `paperclip-492823`, called by Claude Code at runtime, authenticated via `paperclip-runtime-sa`'s `roles/aiplatform.user`. **No long-lived Anthropic API key.** |
| GCS HMAC interop credentials | `paperclip-s3-access-key-id` + `paperclip-s3-secret-access-key` Secret Manager entries → injected into Cloud Run service env, consumed by Paperclip's S3 storage backend |
